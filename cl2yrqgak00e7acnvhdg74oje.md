As web development grows and evolves, it's important that we software developers continue to learn and teach ourselves new technologies. One great framework to add to your skill stack this year (if you haven't already) is React js. 

React was introduced in 2013 by Facebook, and has since successfully risen above most other frontend frameworks in terms of [usage](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1124699/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-frameworks-web/) and popularity. React developers are some of the most in-demand developers around the world as companies adopt React in their tech stack. So if you've been thinking about it, now is the perfect time to jump in and start your journey of learning React in 2022. Here are some great courses to start with!

Scrimba is an online learning platform whose "goal is to create the best possible coding school at the lowest possible cost for students."(from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/about))

To make it possible, they have created a new video format for their code screencasts which they call "scrims". In this, you can pause the video at any given time and edit the code which your instructor was using to teach you. This makes [the course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) fun and interactive and results in quick learning for the students. 

## 2. Epic React by Kent C Dodds

This is an [epic course](https://epicreact.dev/) on React by an Epic Instructor, Kent C. Dodds. Kent is a JavaScript engineer, Co-Founder, and Director of Developer Experience at Remix.

This course teaches you React Fundamentals, React Hooks, Advanced React Hooks, Advanced React Patterns, React Performance, Testing React Apps, React Suspense, and a final section on "Build an Epic React App". 

Apart from this massive 19 hours in-depth course, you'll also get multiple bonus interviews with industry experts once you enroll in it. This is a paid course and not the ideal one for novice developers, it requires a prior in-depth understanding of HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript.

## 3. Full Stack Open

[Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) by the University of Helsinki is one of the best Full Stack React Development courses on the internet. This course teaches you how to build modern web applications with JavaScript centering around building single page applications with React that use REST APIs built with NodeJS.

Although it's a full-stack development course, it contains a great deal of content on building React apps. The course is updated annually and therefore more great content on the latest web technologies is added every year. As of Feb 2022, this course contains sections on React, Redux, NodeJS, MongoDB, Testing, GraphQL, TypeScript, React Native, CI/CD, Containers, and Relational Databases. 

It's a text-based course and the best part is that it's 100% free. If you are someone who wants to badly learn modern full-stack development, this is your way. If you only want to learn React, consider reading the React related parts of the course, you'll certainly love it.

## 4. React Docs

This is not a course, but [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/) of React, and what more good it can be than learning React directly from the source. The documentation is easy to understand, well-maintained, and filled with examples. An updated [beta version](https://beta.reactjs.org/) of the same documentation has also been released a few months ago by React team. The new documentation emphasizes functional components while the old docs focused more on class components.

As of May 2022, the *Learn React* section and *API reference* section of the beta docs are ~70% and ~20% finished. If you prefer reading more than watching or love to jump directly on docs instead of third party tutorials, you should check it out once. 

## 5. Egghead React beginners course

![Screenshot 2022-05-09 184805.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652102298729/gsyISGip-.png align="left")

[Egghead’s React course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) is also a great option to get your hands dirty. Another course taught by Kent C. Dodds in our list, it has a total timespan of 2 hours 35 minutes and is divided into 30 small sections.

It’s an ideal course for beginners to get started, unlike Epic React. It takes you from absolute basics to deploying your React application with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify.

The course is 100% free and if you prefer video lectures over blogposts and documentation, this course is a great step to start your React journey.

## 6. 15 React projects course by Freecodecamp
Learning about concepts is one thing and implementing those concepts into projects is another. This course will teach you exactly that, how to implement whatever you have learned and build cool projects with it.

This is a project-based [YouTube video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) by Freecodecamp where you’ll build 15 cool projects in React. You can take up this course if you’re feeling a bit itchy and want to work on more projects or if your preferred courses don’t include many projects.

Just try not to fall into a tutorial hell because eventually you have to learn to come up with solutions on your own but in the beginning, it’s completely fine to build projects watching tutorials.

## 7. Complete React Developer in 2022 w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)

![Screenshot 2022-05-09 184858.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652102347575/N1THzPcMH.png align="left")

[The Complete React Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) is your guide to being a complete React developer in 2022. Apart from teaching the core concepts of React, this course also takes a look at Routing, Redux, Firebase, Stripe payments, Advanced React hooks, Deployment, Context API, GraphQL, React performance, Progressive Web Apps and so much more.

You will learn all these concepts while building a massive E-commerce React app and this course will also teach you things outside the core React concepts which are important in building enterprise-level applications.

## 8. React Front to Back 2022

![Screenshot 2022-05-09 184940.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1652102389649/TXtwepzRw.png align="left")

This is an excellent [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) by Traversy Media's famed Brad Traversy. It’s a great course for those who want more depth and also build more projects alongside working on the course. There are a total of four React projects in this course which also includes a fullstack MERN app and a Firebase 9 app.

This course starts with the basics of React and goes up to the deployment of your projects and includes all the common concepts of React which you’ll most of the time use while building React applications.

It’s a well rounded course with a focus on building different projects giving you a close view of what you’ll be doing with React in the real world.

## Parting Thoughts
If you are a beginner just looking to start learning React, my suggestion to you would be to first check all the courses I mentioned above, glance over the contents, and see what topics are similar across all the courses and what are unique things in each course. 

Think about your motivation for learning React once again and choose the course which you think will take you close to your goals. Eventually, you’ll learn everything with experience and building projects but It’s important to stick to one path, in the beginning, to learn things faster.
