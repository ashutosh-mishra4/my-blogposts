## The Complete Python Masterclass: My Journey Towards Learning Python

Python is my favorite programming language since the beginning of my programming journey. However, I didn't spend enough time learning it properly. My journey took me from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript route.

However, I am restarting the Python course called **The Complete Python Masterclass** I bought 3 years ago on Udemy but never finished :)

Here's the  [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-masterclass-course/)  to the course, in case you're curious to know. It's the best Python course I've found online, so if you wish you can certainly enroll in it.

**The course covers the core Python concepts like -**

- Basic Python Concepts(variables, strings, user input, maths, etc)
- Control Structures in Python
- Functions and Modules in Python
- Exception Handling and File Handling in Python
- Some More types in Python
- Functional Programming in Python
- Object Oriented Programming in Python
- Regular Expressions in Python

**Apart from that, the course also touches - **

- Tkinter
- Database apps with Python and PostgreSQL
- File Compression
- Data Analysis
- Django
- Flask
- Web Scraping
- Image Processing
- Automation etc.

Not to forget this is a project based course and to validate your learning you'll build projects like **Calculator, Password Manager, QR Code Generator, Video Downloader, Expense Manager, Facebook Autoposter, etc.** while following the course and you'll also be challenged to build certain advanced projects on your own. 

Currently, there are 9 projects in the challenge which you've to build on your own. So if you completed the whole course sincerely, you'll build a total of 23 awesome projects enough for you to become a Python ninja.

I'll document my whole learning journey in a series of posts and share what I learn here on my blog. So if it sounds interesting follow me to not miss any post in the series.

*Happy Coding!*
